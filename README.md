This is a laravel package which allows you to pull data from a backdrop cms site, configured with the headles module. Thus you can use the backdrop site as a backend and laravel as front end.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require robertgarrigos/backdrop-headless-client
```
Optionally, you can use `artisan vendor publish` to publish a config file.

You need to add a config value in your .env file for the backdrop api url as:

```
BACKDROP_API_SERVER="https://example.com"
```

## Usage

To make use of this package, you need to install and config a [backdrop cms](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop) site with the [headless module](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/headless), which is reponsible to create the JSON end points.

You acces those endpoints in your controller with:

```php
/* Nodes (v2): /api/v2/node/{type}/{id} */

$node = Backdrop::getNode($type, $id);

/* Terms: /api/{vocabulary}/term/{id} */

$term = Backdrop::getTerm($vocabulary, $id);

/* Views (v2): /api/v2/views/{view_name}/{display_id}{arguments} */

$view = Backdrop::getView($view, $display_id, $args);

/* Paragraphs (v2): /api/v2/paragraphs/{type}/{id} */

$paragraph = Backdrop::getParagraph($type, $id);
```
